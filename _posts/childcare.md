A map of childcare providers in the Upper Valley can be found at [https://eceauv.org/finding-childcare-in-the-upper-valley/](https://eceauv.org/finding-childcare-in-the-upper-valley/). We encourage you to look at the reviews of daycares listed on this page, read the websites and request tours to make sure they meet your needs, and consider whether you are interested in center-based and/or home-based daycare.

Please note that currently Geisel medical students are not eligible for the daycare centers at Dartmouth College or DHMC. Preschools and daycare centers that medical students have successfully sent their children to in the past include Immersion Montessori, Norwich Nursery School, Toddlerâ€™s Morning Out, and CCUV.

The webpage above also includes income eligibility for childcare financial assistance in New Hampshire and Vermont. As of 2024, individuals pursuing a doctoral degree are eligible for childcare financial assistance in Vermont. A letter from the Registrar indicating you are a full-time student in good standing and a copy of your academic schedule will be required for the application. In New Hampshire, doctoral students are not eligible to receive childcare financial assistance. Thus, currently we recommend living in Vermont if you meet the income requirements and wish to receive childcare financial assistance. Some daycare centers, like the CCUV, also have sliding scale tuition.

It can take a significant amount of time to get off the waitlists for daycare in the Upper Valley, so it is advisable to get on waitlists as soon as possible. You may consider getting on waitlists as soon as you get pregnant or know you will be moving to the Upper Valley.
