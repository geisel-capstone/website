## National Rights for Individuals who are Pregnant

### Title IX

Under Title IX, medical schools are required to provide accommodations to pregnant students:

- Flexibility with class schedules and exam dates
- Adjustments for clinical rotations
- Additional support if needed, such as time off for medical recovery after childbirth

Schools should also provide a nondiscriminatory environment and allow students to continue their education without facing penalties due to pregnancy.

### Disability Accommodation

Pregnant students who experience complications or disabilities related to pregnancy may be entitled to accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), especially if the complications limit their ability to participate in certain educational activities.

### School Policies

Many medical schools have their own policies regarding pregnancy, maternity leave, and accommodations. These can vary, but they often include options for extending time to complete coursework or clinical rotations. Some schools offer specific guidance on maternity leave and how students can work with faculty to manage their studies during pregnancy.

### Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

If a medical student is employed, they may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. However, medical students in clinical years should check with their institutions as each medical school has different policies on accommodating students.
